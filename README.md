In this project, 
In this project, we created a site that is concerned with providing comfort and beauty services and the ease of booking any service the customer wants.
We made sure that the site is clear in the services provided and their details.
On our site, we aim to reach every woman looking for beauty and places of rest and relaxation, and we hope to serve them in the best way.
Our website offers many services, including:
-	See photos of the salon and get an idea about it.
-	View all services.
-	Show Prices.
-	View a brief overview of each service.
-	The ability to specify the required service and make a reservation.

Look & Feel:
Because we chose the name Lavender for our website, we chose the purple color as the main color in the design, in relation to the color of the flower. It is important that we focus on arranging the pages according to the content to be clear and accessible.

Dynamic Components
This file contains all the functions that we used in HTML, in order to make the project folder clear and tidy. We did not use many files.
The file name is javascript.js

The other JavaScript file contains the Node.js functions.
The file name is backend_node.js

Business Logic
We linked our project to the Mango database, the username, email and password information is stored for each person who logs in to the site. 
we create User object  (User  is the model) then save the information that actual user enter by using the html forms(signup) that we created , then we put  save method to Saves this document by inserting a new document into the database , after that directory will open login page, when user enter username and password this data be compared  with stored data in database
